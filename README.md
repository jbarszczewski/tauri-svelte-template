# Tauri Svelte App Template

This is a project template for [Tauri](https://tauri.studio) and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) apps. It lives at https://github.com/jbarszczewski/tauri-svelte-template.

To create a new project based on this template follow the official guide here: https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
yarn
```

...then start development server:

```bash
yarn tauri dev
```

This will take care of running both frontend and backend of your app with watch attached to both. That means whenever you change something in `src` (svelte frontend code) or `src-tauri` (rust backend code), it will be automatically processed and hot reloaded. To finish dev/debug mode simply close the app window.

## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
yarn tauri build
```

This will create standalone app and installer in `src-tauri/target/release` directory.
